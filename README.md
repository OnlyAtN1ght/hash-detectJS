### hash-detectJS

detect-hash is a JavaScript module that allows you to detect the algorithm used to produce a hash. It works by matching the hash against a list of regular expressions and hash algorithms, and returns a list of possible algorithms that the hash could have been produced with. This can be useful for security and forensic applications.


## Installation
To install this module, run the following command:

```
npm install detect-hash
```

## Usage

To use this module in your JavaScript code, you can import it using the `require` function:

```
const detectHash = require('detect-hash');
```

```
// Use the detectHash function to detect the algorithm used to produce a hash
const algorithm = detectHash('<hash>');
```

## Examples


Here are some examples of how to use the `detectHash` function:

```
// Import the detectHash function
const detectHash = require('detect-hash');

// Use the detectHash function to detect the algorithm used to produce a hash
const algorithm = detectHash('<hash>');
console.log(algorithm); // Output: [<algorithm1>, <algorithm2>, ...]

// Use the detectHash function with a custom list of regular expressions and hash algorithms
const regexHashMap = {
  "<regex1>": "<algorithm1>",
  "<regex2>": "<algorithm2>",
  ...
};
const algorithm = detectHash('<hash>', regexHashMap);
console.log(algorithm); // Output: [<algorithm1>, <algorithm2>, ...]
```


## Configuration

By default, the `detectHash` function uses a built-in list of regular expressions and hash algorithms to detect the algorithm used to produce a hash. You can customize this behavior by providing a custom list of regular expressions and hash algorithms in the form of a JSON object. For example:

```
const detectHash = require('detect-hash');

// Customize the list of regular expressions and hash algorithms
const regexHashMap = {
"<regex1>": "<algorithm1>",
"<regex2>": "<algorithm2>",
...
};

// Use the detectHash function with the custom list of regular expressions and hash algorithms
const algorithm = detectHash('<hash>', regexHashMap);
```

## Improuvment 

**Add support for more hash algorithms:** The module currently only supports a limited number of hash algorithms, and adding support for more algorithms could make it more useful for a wider range of applications.

**:Optimize the performance of the module:**: The module currently uses a brute-force approach to matching hashes against regular expressions, which may not be efficient for large datasets. Optimizing the performance of the module, such as by using faster algorithms or parallel processing, could make it more practical for use with large datasets.
